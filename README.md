AutoML-as-a-Service | End-to-End ML System with Streamlit, Optuna, and MLflow
This project is a full-stack AutoML application built with modern ML tooling. It allows users to upload tabular datasets and automatically trains, tunes, and ranks five machine learning models. The app detects task type (classification or regression), optimizes hyperparameters using Optuna, tracks experiments with MLflow, and visualizes performance via an interactive leaderboard.
